Postgres is the free to use opensource DBS system which is vastly superior to Oracle, MS SQL Server and mySQL for reasons.

It is easy to use on Linux and easy enough on windows if you mess around enough.

I messed around a bunch till I figured it out on windows:

The first and foremost step is to access the psql service as postgres or the superuser. On this pc the password for postgres is sql.

You don't really need a password on linux, just do sudo -su postgres and you become the postgres user.

Here you need to write this code into powershell:

psql -U postgres -h localhost
It'll prompt for a login. There is a way to do this in one line or to eliminate the password requirement (by messing with the md5 security setting in a file in psql).

Once you enter psql as postgres create a database for yourself and kaBLAM you're done!

create database ariel with owner postgres;

This creates a database named ariel where you can store tables and the owner is postgres.

Unfortunately, postgres doesn't recognize me as a user for some reason. I'm not really sure why so I named the user postgres which it does recognize.


Now, enter that database

psql -d ariel -U postgres -W -h localhost

#Terms:
#psql is the way to use postgres
# -d is a flag for database. After that write the name of the database.
# -U is a flag for user. After that write the name of the user.
# -W is a flag for prompt for a password. It will prompt you for a password.
# h is a flag for hosting. You need to host a server in order to access a
# database. The host server in this case is localhost, or your personal pc.

Once you enter that you'll be in the database called ariel. Again the password is sql.
